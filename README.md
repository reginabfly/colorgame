# Color Picker Game

The Color Picker Game was built utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This fun little game was a way to practice using JavaScript to manipulate the page utilizing event listeners, for loops and functions.

## About The Game

At the top of the game, there is an RGB code. You have to click on the image that you think matches the RBG color value. If you click on the correct color, then all the blocks will turn to that color and you win. 

There are two versions of the game also. If you click on "Easy" then you only have to choose from three blocks and if you choose "Hard" then there are six blocks you have to choose from. If you don't like the current RGB code at the top, you also have the option of clicking on "New Colors" to try a different RGB code.
